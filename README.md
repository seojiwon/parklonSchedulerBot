This is an automatic scheduler bot for Parklon heat pad.
The mobile app by the company does not have the timer functionality that turns on and off the heating automatically.
This bot adds the functionality to programmatically turn on and off the heating at a scheduled time. 
For example, you can schedule it to turn on the heating at 4am in the morning, which is usually the coldest time of day (to save your electricity bill).
